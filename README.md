# Map Animation
A learning project done though emeritus. This project uses html, javascript, and css to import a map then update markers on that map on the press of a button.

## How to Run
**This repository is currently nonfunctional because I have decativated the MapBox key.**
The "Show Stops Between MIT and Harvard" button causes pointers to sequentially appear on the map, indicating bus stops going from MIT to Harvard.

## Roadmap of Future Improvements
1. Alter code to rely on a free source of map information
2. Add location labels on cursor hover
3. Adjust the timing to be proportionate to the average time the bus takes between these stops
4. Add speed slider to change overall time
